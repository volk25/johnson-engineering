            Johnson Engineering works on residential schemes that offer a better quality of life for communities, 
            genuine value for property developers and a sustainable future for residential buildings. 
            In some places we must consider shrinking household size and growing demand for easy access to public transport, work and urban leisure. 
            In others, changing demographics are driving new demand for high-quality housing.
            Working with leading architects and developers, Johnson Engineering plans, designs and engineers residential buildings of all types. 
            These range from bespoke single dwellings to low-cost modular housing and high-rise towers.

            Whether it concerns offices, production halls or workshops, every organization wants its own form of use of the building. 
            Achieving the highest possible building efficiency starts with listening to the user's wishes and empathizing with the business processes. 
            Based on this, a customer-specific program of requirements can be made, which forms the basis for the further design. 
            Johnson Engineering has knowledge of installation technology as well as architecture and construction, and can therefore approach projects in an integrated manner. 
            Our working method and multidisciplinary knowledge result in smart choices and therefore the highest efficiency.
